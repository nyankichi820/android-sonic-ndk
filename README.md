# Android  Sonic NDK
This is gradle repository Sonic library. Sonic is a native library that allows to change pitch, speed up and slow down speech.
The project targets Android API 27 and compiles with CMake.

### Sonic
Sonic is a cool library that changes speech rate while controlling pitch and makes audio books listenable on high speed.
The library is working with raw PCM data, so I added a decoder for MP3 (and other formats) files.
